# React-native1-Game

### Description
A game made with the react-native Expo CLI as a beginner's project. This project makes use of the basics of react-native by rendering different screens under different conditions.

The user chooses a number and the computer has to guess the number. At each step, after the CPU's guess, the user has to indicate whether his chosen number of greater or lower than the guess (no lying allowed!), and the CPU puts forwards its next guess.

### Instructions to run
1) Download and extract the codes.
2) Make sure nodemon and the expo CLI are installed.
3) cd over to the project directory via the terminal.
4) run the following commands:
    a) npm i (to install all necessary packages)\n
    b) npx expo start\n
5) After the expo server starts, we can run the app on an emulator or our own device via the Expo Go App.

**Note:** iOS simulator will only work with MacOS.
